/**
 * Service interface for managing employee-related operations.
 * Provides methods for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting employee records.
 * <p>
 * Best Practice: Implementations should inject other service classes (e.g., EmploymentInformationService)
 * to handle related entity operations, rather than directly injecting repositories.
 * This promotes modularity, encapsulation of business logic, and separation of concerns.
 * Repositories should be used within service implementations to manage data access,
 * while services orchestrate higher-level business logic and interactions.
 * <p>
 * Example Usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @Autowired
 * private EmployeeService employeeService;
 *
 * // Retrieve all employees with pagination
 * Page<EmployeeResponse> employees = employeeService.findAll(Pageable.ofSize(10));
 *
 * // Find employee by ID
 * Optional<EmployeeResponse> employee = employeeService.findById("123");
 *
 * // Create new employee
 * EmployeeResponse newEmployee = employeeService.create(new EmployeeResponse(...));
 *
 * // Update existing employee
 * EmployeeResponse updatedEmployee = employeeService.update("123", updatedResponse);
 *
 * // Delete employee
 * boolean deleted = employeeService.delete("123");
 * }
 * </pre>
